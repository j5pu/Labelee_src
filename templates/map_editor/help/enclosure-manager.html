        <h1>Introduction to Template</h1>

        <p class="verified"><strong>Template has been verified to work with CodeIgniter 1.7</strong></p>

        <p>The Template library, written for the CodeIgniter PHP-framework, is a
            wrapper for <abbr title="CodeIgniter">CI</abbr>’s View implementation. Template is a reaction to the
            numerous questions from the CI community regarding how one would display
            multiple views for one controller, and how to embed “views within views”
            in a standardized fashion. In addition, Template provides extra Views loading capabilities,
            the ability to utilize any template parser (like Smarty),
            and shortcuts for including CSS, JavaScript, and other common elements in your final
            rendered HTML.</p>

        <h2>Template is right for you if:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You feel like using views can be clunky, especially when "embedding" views.</li>
            <li>You don't like calling header, footer, and other global views from <em>every</em>
                Controller method.</li>
            <li>You prefer having one "master template" that can be changed for any
                controller in order to meet unique application design needs.</li>
            <li>You don't want to drastically alter the way you interface controllers and views.</li>
            <li>You like clear, thorough documentation on par with CodeIgniter's User Guide.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's New in Version 1.4.1?</h2>
        <p>Version 1.4.1 is mostly a maintenance release, fixing comment and documentation typos.
            In addition, the 1.4.1 download now ships with its documentation. And finally, the Template class
            was renamed to work more like a core library so you can extend/overload/replace it in
            your application libraries folder, among other things.</p>

        <h2>Template's Approach</h2>
        <p>Template works by writing to pre-defined regions of a master template. Although you will
            most often write to your template from a Controller,
            you can write content to these regions from any part of your application.
            Content could be a simple string of plain text, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
            or the results from a View. Regions display by echoing variables placed throughout your master
            template as desired. Template also lets you use multiple template configurations, making it
            completely flexible to meet the needs of your application’s design.</p>
        <p>Here's what using template looks like:</p>
        <code>$this-&gt;template-&gt;write('title', 'Introduction to Template');<br />
            $this-&gt;template-&gt;write_view('content', 'blog/posts', $this-&gt;blog-&gt;get_posts());<br />
            $this-&gt;template-&gt;render();</code>
